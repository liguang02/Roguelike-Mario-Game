***UPDATED 2/4/2022 LATEST
	- REMOVED LET IT GROW (implementation too many classes, need to swithc to intefrace style)
	- REMOVED JUMP (CANT TUCH GAME ENGINE) 

***UPDATED 3/4/2022 LATEST
	- COMPLETED FOR ALL CLASSES (not confirmed)
	- Discussed @ 9 - 11


LET IT GROW
- 1 CLASS tree, attribute age = 0 (defaULT) :
	- As turns go on, tick (age++)
	- main method that calls other methods based on age :
		- if less than 10 : sprout methods
		- if less than 20 and more than 10 : sapling methods
		- if more than 20 : mature tree methods


JUMP
- ACTOR
	- PLAYER
		+ Check if player near any 'jumpable objects aka high ground (y coord larger than ori)' e.g. : walls, trees
		+ If player decides to jump :
			- Determine if success or fail (prob = 80%)
			- If fail, player does not move onto the object

	- GOOMBA
	- KOOPA
		+ Cant jump, cant move from high to low via walk
- ITEM
	- SUPER MUSHROOM
		+ If active, always suceed in jump (prob = 100%)
- WALL/TREES
	-Check if player near any 'jumpable objects aka high ground
- MENU
	- If near high ground, give option to jump onto it


ENEMIES
- GOOMBA
	+ implements ACTOR
		+ Set the initial values
		+ Implement randomized Utils method similar to flip() which randomly chooses between heads and tails for the 10%/50% prob.
			- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8183840/probability-in-java
			- Check viability of Randomizer class from project RDX v1.11 to implement here
		+ ATTACKACTION tp attack
			- Randomizer to set attack value attribute in GOOMBA class and call attack action based on it
- KOOPA
	+ implements ACTOR
	+ boolean attribute (dormant or not)
		+ Set the initial values
		+ When defeated, setDisplayChar = D
		+ When dormant, option for player to attack Koopa should destroy its shell
	- MENU
		+ Change the options.
		

MAGICAL ITEMS
- SUPER MUSHROOM
      - Add to map using addItem method (similar to mars game items)
	- PLAYER
		+ Increase HP by 50 (increaseMaxHp method available in Actor)
		+ Change displayChar from m to M (setDisplayChar method available in Actor)
		+ Add status to 100% jump success rate (Add a new status which adds to capabilities list for 100% success rate)
			+ Interacts with jump action to ensure the success
		+ First instance of damage, 
			+ remove the status (set to False?) and capabilities removed from list
			+ Change displayChar from M to m (setDisplayChar method available in Actor)
		
- POWER STAR
	- Add to map using addItem method (similar to mars game items)
	- Creates new counter which starts at 10, every turn -1, until 0 where the buff is removed
	- PLAYER
		+ Heals 200 HP (heal method available in Actor)
		+ Adds higher grounds buff (boolean status/capabilities list?)
			- WALL implementation?
		+ Immunity buff (boolean status/capabilities list?)
			- ATTACKACTION implementation to change this
		 	- Maybe change value of enemy attacks to 0 during this duration?
		+ Insta kill buff (boolean status/capabilities list?)
			- ATTACKACTION implementation to change this
			- - Maybe change value of attacks to 999 during this duration to enssure kills?
	- WALL
		+ new method implement to destroy wall when status active?
			-ITEM
			 + create coins at the location on destroy (? implementation)
	- MENU
		+ Add message until buff is over


TRADES
- WALLET + INVENTORY CLASS
	+ attributes : int money, arraylist of items
	+ methods : addMoney, removeMoney, addItems, removeItems
- ACTOR
